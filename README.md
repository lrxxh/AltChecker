# AltChecker
This is an alt checker for Minecraft. It's made in Python, but you can also use the .exe version if you don't have Python installed. DM me at lrxh#0001 if you have any issues or need help with anything,


# Want to compile the src to an .exe yourself?

1. Download AltChecker.py and put it in a new folder.

2. In the same directory, open cmd and type
```pip install requests```

3. After that, in the same CMD type
```pip install pyinstaller```

4. In the same cmd, do
```pyinstaller AltChecker.py --onefile```

5. Now you should have multiple folders generated. Click on **Dist**, and inside there should be the .exe.
